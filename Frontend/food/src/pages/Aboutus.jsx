Our goal is to create a digital restaurant that delivers the same joy, freshness, and satisfaction you'd expect from your favorite local place — but with the convenience of a modern online system.

`


const paragraph4 = `This restaurant platform is not just a portfolio project. It’s a representation of real-world needs met with technical and creative solutions.

✅ Rishabh Restaurant proves that a student or aspiring developer can:

✅ Build real, scalable platforms with modern tools.

✅ Understand full-stack systems — from UI/UX to backend APIs.

✅ Apply database management and authentication flows securely.

✅ Think like a customer, design like an engineer, and deliver like a brand.

✅ We believe this project can serve:

✅ College students practicing food tech innovation

✅ Local businesses trying to go online

✅ Users who want an affordable, simple app to order from

✅ Developers who want to learn from a real-world working model

✅ This project shows that even a simple food delivery idea, when mixed with passion and purpose, can become a professional-grade system.

`

const paragraph5 = `The journey of Rishabh Restaurant started with a simple idea — “What if I could build a real restaurant app that not only works but also feels professional?”

As a student and a developer, I (Rishabh) wanted to create something meaningful, practical, and helpful. Something more than just “another demo project.”
I looked around and realized how much people love food. And also how much they struggle to find clean, reliable, and digital platforms that offer homemade-style meals with the speed of technology.

This led to the idea of building Rishabh Restaurant — a platform where:

✅ A customer can browse food items with attractive UI.

✅ Users can log in, save their cart, and place orders.

✅ Admins can manage food inventory from the backend.

✅ Orders can be tracked, edited, and monitored smoothly.

What started as a coding experiment turned into a fully functional web application using some of the most powerful technologies available. Every line of code, every food item, and every feature was thoughtfully designed to mimic the real-world restaurant experience.

✅This wasn’t built in one night. It took weeks of:

✅ Designing frontend pages with responsiveness

✅ Structuring RESTful backend APIs

✅ Handling session-based authentication

✅ Creating dynamic database schemas

✅ Debugging, testing, and improving UI/UX

Today, Rishabh Restaurant proudly stands as an end-to-end food ordering platform that can easily be used by restaurants, cafes, or cloud kitchens to go online.

const paragraph6=`Every successful restaurant has two sides:

A kitchen that delivers taste 🍛
A backend that delivers experience 💻

👨‍💻 Development Team (Code Kitchen)
The app was built by Rishabh (me), a passionate full-stack Python developer with a focus on practical, real-world applications. I worked on:

Frontend: React.js + Tailwind CSS
🔹 Backend: Flask
🔹 Database: Sqlite3
🔹 Session management
🔹 Admin controls
🔹 Cart and ordering logic
🔹 Toast notifications & authentication UX

👨‍🍳 Kitchen Team (Food Experts)
Though this is a virtual restaurant for now, it has been designed to integrate with real-world kitchen workflows, like:

Food preparation status
Daily menus
Price management
Order history tracking

This means real chefs or admin staff can actually use the dashboard to manage a live kitchen environment.

`

const paragraph7=`Behind the simple user interface is a robust and powerful tech stack:

🔹 Frontend – React.js
🔹 Built using Vite for fast loading and hot module replacement
🔹 Tailwind CSS for elegant and responsive UI
🔹 Axios for API integration
🔹 Toast notifications for smooth UX
🔹 LocalStorage for cart/session handling
🔹 Backend – Python (Flask)
🔹 RESTful API endpoints
🔹 Session-based authentication (no JWT)
🔹 User login, signup, logout
🔹 Cart management and order storage
🔹 Admin panel APIs
🔹 Database – Sqllite3
🔹 Tables for users, food items, cart, orders
🔹 Data handled securely using parameterized queries
🔹 Relationships built using foreign keys
🔹 Optimized queries for performance
🔹 Other Features
🔹 Cart is user-specific and maintained even after login
🔹 Admin can add, update, or delete items dynamically
🔹 Error handling, toast messages, and route protections implemented
🔹 Clean folder structure and code documentation for easy understanding

`

const paragraph8=`At Rishabh Restaurant, food hygiene isn’t an afterthought — it’s the foundation of everything we do.
We understand the importance of safety, especially in the digital food era where customers expect quality, cleanliness, and trust in every bite.

Our Hygiene Protocol Includes:
🔪 Using only fresh and verified ingredients
🔪 Ensuring that every dish is prepared in a clean and sanitized environment
🔪 Packaging food with safe, eco-friendly material
🔪 Regular kitchen cleaning schedules
🔪 Temperature-controlled storage
🔪 Strict handwashing and glove protocols for chefs
🔪 No reuse of oil or leftover food
🔪 If this system is deployed in the real world, these safety standards are already integrated in the admin module:
🔪 Daily checklist for hygiene
🔪 Admin alerts if a food item expires soon
🔪 Inventory expiry tracking

We believe:
“Clean food is not a luxury — it’s a responsibility.”

`

const paragraph9 = `The ordering system in Rishabh Restaurant has been carefully designed to be:

🔹Simple for users
🔹 Robust for developers
🔹 Transparent for admins

Step-by-Step Flow:
✅Browse Food:
User lands on the home page and sees all food items fetched from backend.

✅ Add to Cart:
User can add any item, adjust quantity (using + / - buttons). Cart is unique per user.

✅ Login/Signup:
Session-based login ensures user state is preserved. No JWT used.

✅ Proceed to Checkout:
A final cart summary with total amount, delivery details, and an option to place the order.

✅ Order Placed:
Items are transferred to an order_items table with timestamp and user ID.

✅ Order History:
Users can check all previous orders in a dedicated section.

✅ Admin Panel Notification:
Admin sees all placed orders with status. Orders can be marked as "Preparing", "Out for Delivery", or "Delivered".

`
const paragraph10 = `Behind every good platform is an empowered admin panel. At Rishabh Restaurant, the admin role is more than just managing items — it’s managing the whole operation.

Admin Capabilities:
🔹 Login securely into the admin dashboard
🔹 Add new food items with image, price, category
🔹 Edit existing dishes instantly
🔹 Delete outdated or unavailable items
🔹 View and manage user orders
🔹 Update order status (Live, Delivered, Cancelled)
🔹 Monitor inventory count
🔹 Track user activity and demand trends
🔹 This panel is built to be scalable. Even if you grow from 50 items to 500, the admin UI won't lag or break.
🔹 Built using Python backend and Oracle database, the admin APIs are:
🔹 Authenticated and protected
🔹 Clean and well-structured
🔹 Easy to test and extend
🔹 Admins are like the chefs of the backend — and we’ve given them the best kitchen.
